Pasting into VirtualBox

For example, you have a virtual machine inside Oracle VirtualBox. And OS in your virtual machine is not supported by Guest Additions.

But you need to paste some long text. Now you can use it with this script.

Supported host OS: Windows, but potentially cross-platform, you need to change only `getpath` function to make it work under other OS. I never used VirtualBox inside Linux, so I don't know, how to determine paths. If anyone knows, please create issue or pull request.
